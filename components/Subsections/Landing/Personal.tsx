            I am proud to say that I wear a lot of hats with my past
            collaborations. Since I was younger, I've always been used to doing
            stuff on my own, and I've always being a self-starter.
            <br />
            <br />I don't know how this happened but I tend to always give
            feedback to things that may not even be related to my field of
            expertise. Gradually I've learned how to make relatively beautiful
            things, and I've also learned how to be compassionate to the team,
            the product, and the end users.

              I don't know man but it brings me so much joy being able to be
              part of a product (or a feature) since the ideation stage and
              *especially* coding it out. So long as I can code, titles or range of
              responsibilities hardly matter to me.

          I attended community college for two years before transferring at my
          current uni. I remember I didn't know much about tech and in fact I

          I was working so I can fund my studies and the things that I've
          learned in both places were fundamental into who I am today.

          In comm. college, I was studying alongside other people:
          highschoolers, immigrant working class parents, and old people who

          different beautiful problems; problems that allow me to emphasize with
          them, from where I am.
